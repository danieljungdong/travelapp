This is a project requirement for Udacity's front end nanodegree program. 

## Learning goals
My goals for this course is to learn the following
- Use webpack to manage the front end and back end code and enable faster testing
- Gain more experience directly developing and styling a webpage with display:grid and display:flex. 
- Gain some experience using test frameworks in javascript (jest)
- Review some concepts that I've learned while hacking my own side projects. 

## Extend Options
- Remove trip functionality when a trip is showing
- Adding multi day forecast (day 7-14) when trip is not within the next 7 days
